I am a hardware engineer with over 20 years of experience in LCD, Micro LED, and OLED panel companies. I use a lot of experimental data in the manufacturing industry to develop panels, and R is more effective than Excel and Minitab for data analysis, so I use R for analysis every day. Recently, I've also been working on machine learning with Python at Quarto. 
 Through my experience, I prepared a lecture on manufacturing data processing and analysis using R and gave a lecture at a university.  
 I always enjoy learning and my hobbies include inline skating and traveling.
